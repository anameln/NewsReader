(Wild cobia is usually caught recreationally or as by-catch by fishermen looking for other species.)

It has been around since the 19th century, an idea buffered by the fact that most major scientific contributions in the 20th century came from men. But even 100 years ago, a fierce debate raged on whether the difference reflected that men are indeed naturally smarter or if it were a byproduct of social conditioning, which includes access to education and society\\u0026#8217;s expectations. If it were social, you\\u0026#8217;d expect the distributions to look more similar today because attitudes and access to education has changed.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut even in these enlightened times, men still do display a wider range of intellectual ability. Using several different measures of intelligence including \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wendy_Johnson3/publication/240323443_Sex_Differences_in_Variability_in_General_Intelligence_A_New_Look_at_the_Old_Question/links/0c960527272f2b12b8000000.pdf\\\"\\u003EIQ\\u003C/a\\u003E and SAT scores, more men are found in the high and low tails, according to Josh Aronson a professor of applied psychology at NYU. \\u0026#8220;Yes, the pattern that I see most often in the IQ literature, and the one that accords with my experience of nearly 40 years being near universities, is that you find more men at the extremes of performance, more among the mind-blowingly brilliant handful that you meet in a lifetime, and also more among the truly intellectually challenged handful. Within the extreme tails of the distribution, however, performance is generally equal between the sexes. But yes, men seem to have an edge at the extreme right end of of the bell curve.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn whether it is biological or environmental he says: \\u0026#8220;I think some of that is social, but I would be surprised if it were all social.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://tip.duke.edu/about/research/intelligence_article.pdf\\\"\\u003EResearchers at Duke\\u003C/a\\u003E studied SAT scores of intellectually promising 7th graders (ages 12 to 13) over the last 30 years. The figure below took the ratio of boys to girls that scored in the top 1%, 0.5% and 0.01% of the distribution in math scores (girls have a slight edge on the verbal SAT, but the differences are not nearly as large).\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"atlas-chart\\\" data-id=\\\"VkYQ0d7u\\\" data-width=\\\"640\\\" data-height=\\\"409\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUp to the top 1%, boys and girls are nearly equal. But the higher into the tail you get, the bigger the differences emerge and the boys dominate. In the 1980s there were 13.5 boys for every girl in the top 0.01%, now it is only about 3.8. The decline shows a large share of the gap was social conditioning, girls being told they could not be great at math or encouraged to take hard math classes. But a significant gap remains—some of if representing that we have further to go and some of it raising more uncomfortable questions about differences in innate ability.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDave Lubinski, psychology professor at Vanderbilt University, also studies the SAT scores of precocious 7th graders and tracks what happened to them in their careers. The oldest cohort is now 50 years old. He says once you narrow the population down to the 1%-ers in math, boys do score slightly higher. \\u0026#8220;But conditional on being in the 1% of math, the girls have better verbal skills.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis suggests women may be less likely to be extreme math stars, but they display a more well-rounded intelligence. It\\u0026#8217;s hard to separate out what\\u0026#8217;s biological and environmental because intelligence reflects what you study and how intensely you pursue it. People are often drawn to what they are good at and what they have access to. Lubinski and his coauthors observed women are more drawn to working with people and jobs that prize communication.

After burrowing through some fur—or hair—the tick latches into a nice patch of skin, saws through flesh, inserts its straw-like mouth-tube, and starts sucking away on blood. Once it has gulped down this first bloodmeal, which takes a few days, the tick drops to the ground, ready to molt into the next stage of its life cycle: a nymph.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe trouble with mice\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor Lyme transmission, this first bloodmeal is critical. A larval tick isn\\u0026#8217;t born carrying the Lyme spirochetes. It needs to pick up the bacteria from the host it feeds on.

A single deer might feed 100 adult ticks, which drop off and lay as many 3,000 eggs each, Indiana University\\u0026#8217;s Clay says. But deer are usually much too big for larvae and nymphs to grab hold of—which is why they\\u0026#8217;re not the real culprit for the spread of Lyme.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;The resurgence of deer population is an overblown factor,\\u0026#8221; says Richard Ostfeld, disease ecologist at the Cary Institute, one of the leading research centers working on Lyme disease. \\u0026#8220;Our research suggests that white-footed mice are more important numerically. Basically, mice are a fantastic host for both the tick and [the bacteria that causes Lyme].\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhite-footed mice infect 75%-95% of larval ticks that feed on them, according to Ostfeld\\u0026#8217;s \\u003Cem\\u003ELyme Disease: The Ecology of a Complex System\\u003C/em\\u003E. Deer infect only about 1%. So while deer are key to helping the adult ticks get the blood they need to reproduce, it\\u0026#8217;s mice that are crucial in helping the disease-causing bacteria spread to infant ticks.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne big reason is simply that white-footed mice are sloppy groomers. Most mammals will claw, bite, or lick ticks off their bodies while scratching or cleaning themselves, often killing the tick in the process. But scientists sometimes find a few dozen ticks latched onto a single tiny mouse.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd it so happens that our slicing and dicing of forests has wiped out the creatures fond of preying on white-footed mice. \\u0026#8220;They thrive when we screw things up,\\u0026#8221; says Ostfeld. It\\u0026#8217;s why they\\u0026#8217;re likely the most abundant small vertebrate in the woody areas of the northeast. Though biologists haven\\u0026#8217;t been tracking white-footed mice numbers very consistently, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://stkctr.biol.sc.edu/Reprints/Reprints_4/Deitloffetal_2010.pdf\\\"\\u003Ea study in Minnesota\\u003C/a\\u003E (pdf, p.196) suggested rising abundance since the 1980s.

Biologists aren\\u0026#8217;t sure, but the going theory, says Ostfeld, is that it depends on the weather.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter lying dormant for winter, adult ticks emerge in the spring, find a bloodmeal—probably a deer—and lay their eggs; those start hatching in midsummer (that\\u0026#8217;s the blue spike in the chart at right). In the American midwest, these newborn larvae often fail to find a bloodmeal before chilly fall weather forces them into dormancy for the winter. When they wake again in the spring, two things will happen. First, they\\u0026#8217;ll be feeding on hosts early in the season, weeks before these animals have become infectious. Second, there\\u0026#8217;ll be relatively fewer nymphs around to infect new hosts. And thus, the chain of transmission gets broken.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the American northeast, however, the autumn weather stays warm long enough that a higher percentage of newborn larvae manage to feed, molt, and spend the winter as dormant nymphs. When they come out of hibernation, they\\u0026#8217;ll have time to bite and infect new animal hosts well before the next generation of larvae can hatch and feed. In some places, as many as \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2015/feb/climate-change-may-affect-tick-life-cycles-lyme-disease\\\"\\u003Eone in four nymphal blacklegged ticks\\u003C/a\\u003E carry the bacterium.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis, scientists think, is one factor explaining why Lyme plagues New England residents more than it does American midwesterners.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe mean temperature for October in the US northeast has risen an average 0.1°F (0.06°C) each decade during the last century, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us\\\"\\u003Eaccording to the National Centers for Environmental Information\\u003C/a\\u003E. That\\u0026#8217;s nearly double the rate across the continental US. The upper midwest—where synchronous feeding occurs, in theory—has been warming at the same rate as the northeast, and in some places even faster. However, it\\u0026#8217;s still much colder there. For instance, in eastern-central Minnesota, the state\\u0026#8217;s Lyme epicenter, October\\u0026#8217;s temperatures have averaged 45.9°F since 2000, compared with the New York Hudson Valley\\u0026#8217;s 51.3°F.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAdmittedly, climate is probably not the whole story. For instance, it doesn\\u0026#8217;t explain why ticks feed synchronously in both frigid Minnesota and the much more temperate UK. And unfortunately, it\\u0026#8217;s near-impossible to know what larvae are up to for sure, says Ostfeld, because they\\u0026#8217;re too tiny to track in the wild.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut if the theory is right, places where Lyme has been relatively muted up to now could be in for trouble.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;If falls get warmer in the midwest, then you\\u0026#8217;d expect more asynchrony,\\u0026#8221; says Ostfeld. \\u0026#8220;That should make Lyme disease get worse there.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EBad news for humans\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat all this means for people is still pretty simple: The best protection against Lyme is not to get bitten. The next best defense is nipping the problem in the blood-filled bud. Since it can take a while for the spirochetes to travel from the tick into the new host\\u0026#8217;s bloodstream, removing a tick within 24 hours of its attaching dramatically \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/transmission/blacklegged.html\\\"\\u003Eslashes one\\u0026#8217;s chance of getting Lyme\\u003C/a\\u003E, according to the CDC. And as Avril Lavigne\\u0026#8217;s experience reveals, getting swift treatment is critical too.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe trouble is, while you might think you\\u0026#8217;re good at plucking off ticks after a stroll through some underbrush, the ones you find are probably adult ticks. About the size of a match head—and as big as a pea once engorged with blood—they\\u0026#8217;re relatively easy for vigilant humans to see and feel.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENymphs, though, are roughly half the size of adults, about \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/transmission/blacklegged.html\\\"\\u003Ethe size of a poppy seed\\u003C/a\\u003E. Tiny enough to pass for a smallish mole or freckle, they\\u0026#8217;re far harder to find than adults are; no surprise, then, that most human Lyme infections \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/transmission/\\\"\\u003Ecome from nymphs\\u003C/a\\u003E.
